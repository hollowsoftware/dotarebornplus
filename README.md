# Dota 2: Reborn+

Dota 2: Reborn+ is a custom game that completely reimagines how Dota 2 plays while keeping everything you love about its visual style and heroes.
Imagine playing Dota with your favorite heroes - but every single ability is different. The map looks familiar but plays completely new. Items you've never seen before. Mechanics that change how fights unfold. That's Reborn+.
You'll recognize the characters. You'll recognize the 5v5 structure. But the moment you start playing, you'll realize: this is a brand new game.

# What Makes It Different?
- Every Hero Has New Abilities
- Every single hero has been completely redesigned with fresh mechanics and playstyles.
- The Map Is Rebuilt
- Same three lanes. Same general structure. But the jungles? Totally different. New camps. New paths. New hiding spots. New neutral bosses beyond Roshan. The tactical landscape is completely fresh.
- Brand New Items
- Forget your old item builds. The shop is filled with completely new items with unique actives and passives. Build paths you've never tried. Combos you've never imagined.
- Everything Plays Differently
- Gold gain? Changed. Experience? Adjusted. Creep waves? Modified. Day/night cycle? Different. The economy, pacing, and flow of the game have been rebalanced from the ground up to create a fresh competitive experience.

# Current Status
