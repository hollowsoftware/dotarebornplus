# Dota 2: Reborn+

Dota 2: Reborn+ is a custom game that completely reimagines how Dota 2 plays while keeping everything you love about its visual style and heroes.
Imagine playing Dota with your favorite heroes - but every single ability is different. The map looks familiar but plays completely new. Items you've never seen before. Mechanics that change how fights unfold. That's Reborn+.
You'll recognize the characters. You'll recognize the 5v5 structure. But the moment you start playing, you'll realize: this is a brand new game.

# What Makes It Different?
- Every Hero Has New Abilities
- Every single hero has been completely redesigned with fresh mechanics and playstyles.
- The Map Is Rebuilt
- New Items
- Everything Plays Differently
